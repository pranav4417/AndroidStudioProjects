# Android Application Repository

This repository contains multiple Android applications demonstrating various UI and functionality components. The apps include examples for handling **Date and Time Pickers**, **Broadcast Receivers**, **UI Components** (OnClickListeners, Spinners, AutoCompleteTextView, RadioGroups), and **Fragments**. Each app provides a practical demonstration of these essential Android components.

## Apps Included

1. **Date and Time Picker Dialog**
   - Demonstrates the use of **DatePickerDialog** and **TimePickerDialog** to let users select a date and time.
  
2. **Broadcast Receiver**
   - Shows how to implement **BroadcastReceiver** to listen for system events or custom broadcasts within your app.

3. **UI Components (OnClickListeners, Spinners, AutoCompleteTextView, RadioGroups)**
   - Demonstrates how to use common UI components like **OnClickListeners**, **Spinners**, **AutoCompleteTextView**, and **RadioGroups** to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
   
4. **Fragments**
   - Demonstrates the usage of **Fragments** to build dynamic and reusable UI components that can be managed independently within an Activity.

## Features of Each App

- **Date and Time Picker Dialog**:
  - **DatePickerDialog**: Select a date.
  - **TimePickerDialog**: Select a time.

- **Broadcast Receiver**:
  - **System Broadcasts**: Respond to system events like connectivity changes.
  - **Custom Broadcasts**: Send and receive custom intents.

- **UI Components**:
  - **OnClickListeners**: Handle button clicks.
  - **Spinners**: Dropdown menus for item selection.
  - **AutoCompleteTextView**: Dynamic text suggestions as you type.
  - **RadioGroups**: Select one option from a set of radio buttons.

- **Fragments**:
  - **Static Fragments**: Defined directly in XML layouts.
  - **Dynamic Fragments**: Added programmatically at runtime.
  - **Communication**: Share data between fragments and their parent activity using interfaces or ViewModels.

## Requirements
- **Android Studio**: Latest version recommended.
- **Android SDK**: API Level 31 (Android 12) or higher.
- **Java**: For programming the functionality.

## How It Works
Each app demonstrates specific Android components and their usage:
- **Date and Time Picker Dialog**: The app allows users to select a date and time using built-in dialogs.
- **Broadcast Receiver**: The app listens for system or custom broadcasts and performs actions accordingly.
- **UI Components**: The app uses buttons, dropdowns, text views, and radio buttons to create interactive UI components.
- **Fragments**: The app demonstrates how to implement and manage fragments in both static and dynamic forms.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle files and ensure dependencies are installed.
4. Run the project on an emulator or a physical device running Android 12 or above.

## Usage
Each project is self-contained. You can explore each folder for the corresponding app. Below are usage instructions for the main components:

- **Date and Time Picker**: Trigger the DatePickerDialog and TimePickerDialog by clicking the associated button.
- **Broadcast Receiver**: Send custom broadcasts or simulate system broadcasts.
- **UI Components**: Interact with buttons, spinners, text inputs, and radio buttons to see how they function.
- **Fragments**: Navigate between static and dynamic fragments, and see how communication happens between fragments and activities.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more complex use cases for **BroadcastReceivers**.
- Enhance **UI Components** with more advanced UI patterns.
- Integrate **Fragments** with Navigation Components for better navigation management.
- Implement better UI/UX design for smoother interaction.
