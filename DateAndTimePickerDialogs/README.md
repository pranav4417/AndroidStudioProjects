# Date and Time Picker Dialog implementation in Android

This project demonstrates the implementation of **DatePickerDialog** and **TimePickerDialog** in an Android application. It provides an intuitive way for users to select a date and time using Android's built-in dialogs.

## Features
- **Date Picker Dialog**: Allows users to select a date.
- **Time Picker Dialog**: Allows users to select a time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use dialogs for date and time selection.
- Supports Android 12 and above.

## Requirements
- **Android Studio**: Latest version recommended.
- **Android SDK**: API Level 31 (Android 12) or higher.
- **Java/Kotlin**: For programming the functionality.


## How It Works
1. **DatePickerDialog**: Displays a calendar view for selecting a date.
2. **TimePickerDialog**: Displays a clock view for selecting the time.

Both dialogs are triggered by button clicks in the app's main activity.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle files and ensure dependencies are installed.
4. Run the project on an emulator or a physical device running Android 12 or above.

## Usage
1. Add buttons for triggering the DatePicker and TimePicker dialogs in `activity_main.xml`.
2. Implement listeners for these buttons in `MainActivity.java`.
3. Use the following code snippets for dialogs:


### DatePickerDialog:
   ```java
   DatePickerDialog datePickerDialog = new DatePickerDialog(
       this,
       (view, year, month, dayOfMonth) -> {
           // Handle selected date
       },
       year, month, day
   );
   datePickerDialog.show();
```

### TimePickerDialog:
```java

TimePickerDialog timePickerDialog = new TimePickerDialog(
    this,
    (view, hourOfDay, minute) -> {
        // Handle selected time
    },
    hour, minute, true
);
timePickerDialog.show();

```
